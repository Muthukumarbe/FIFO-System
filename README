ðŸ”§ Key Features

1. User-Defined FIFO Size: Customize the size to suit various use cases.
2. Push & Pull Operations: Seamless data addition and retrieval.
3. Status Flags:
Full & Empty for capacity monitoring.
Almost Full & Almost Empty for early warnings.
4. Overwrite Mode: Allows overwriting old data when the FIFO is full.
5. Flush Operation: Clears all stored data instantly.
6. Peek Functionality: View the next data without removing it.
7. Configurable Watermarks: Set thresholds for almost_full and almost_empty based on application needs.

ðŸ”— Real-Time Applications

1. Data Buffers: Ideal for buffering data between systems with mismatched speeds, such as in UART, SPI, or network communication.
2. Image/Video Processing: Temporary storage for processing frames in real-time.
3. Embedded Systems: Used in microcontrollers and FPGAs for managing data streams.
4. Audio Streaming: Handles continuous data flow in audio applications.
5. Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS): Task scheduling and inter-task communication.
